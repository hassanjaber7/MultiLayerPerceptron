# MultiLayerPerceptron
A Module in neural network about MLP using python
In this project, a Multilayered Perceptron is implemented and evaluated using two data sets from 
the UCI Machine Learning repository. It was trained using Backpropagation. Additionally, the 
neural network design and the backpropagation mechanism are being implemented at a low level 
in this project.
